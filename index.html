        <img src="images/ghana.jpg" alt="A picture of Ghana.">
        <p>Ghana is a country in West Africa located on the Gulf of Guinea, with borders to Cote d'Ivoire, Burkina Faso,
            and Togo.
            It's known for its tropical climate, diverse geography including savannas and rainforests, and as a stable
            democracy
            with a history of firsts, including being the first sub-Saharan nation to gain independence from colonial
            rule in 1957.
            The economy relies on agriculture, especially cocoa production, and also exports commodities like gold and
            recently
            discovered oil.</p>
